# Classification with Keras
Example of Classification using Neural Network in Keras.
The MNIST data was used in this example. The code uses Neural Network with input dense layers with ReLu activation, hidden layer (with 100 neurons) and Relu activation and an output dense layer with softmax activation. The code calculates the training and validation loss, and accuracy and percent error for the validation data. It also generates the classified and misclassified images. The following figure show the training and validation loss and accuracy versus epoch.
